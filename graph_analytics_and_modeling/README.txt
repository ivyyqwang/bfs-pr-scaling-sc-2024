Before using, please set the project location with the absolute path of where the folder is downloaded to, by altering PROJECT_LOC in julia/shared.jl 


Included folders 
- julia: includes 
- data: includes SNAP & random graphs used in GEM5 simulations, and data used for computing statistics used in models.
- python: includes modeling code for projecting performance for BFS and PageRank routines 

Julia Folder:
